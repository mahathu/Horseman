# Horseman
Simple Spigot plugin that adds more functionality to golden apples.

Description
-----------

This plugin allows you to conjure a horse to ride on temporarily by eating an (unenchanted) Golden Apple. It will disappear immediately on dismount. This functionality is based on the four horsemen of the apocalypse. This plugin serves as a somewhat balanced way to improve the player's means of transportation.


Installation
------------

Download the .jar file from the target directory and put it in the /plugins directory of your server. Restart the server if necessary.


Usage
-----

The plugin has a single command to toggle the functionality without removing the plugin. It is enabled by default:

`/horseman <enable|disable|toggle>`

To conjure a horse, simply consume an unenchanted golden apple. You will automatically be mounted. After unmounting (e.g. by pressing the assigned key or your horse dying), you need to eat another apple to consure another horse.

ToDo
----

List of things I might add in the future (but probably won't):

* Randomize stats of the conjured horse (jump height, strength, max health
* Add a small chance of spawning undead/skeleton horses.
